# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

PrivacyRedirect+ is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it.

## What We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect:

- Personal information
- Browsing history
- IP addresses
- Analytics data
- Telemetry data
- Cookies
- User accounts or identifiers

### Information We DO Collect:

- **Local Settings**: Your preferences (which sites to redirect, whether the extension is enabled) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's Storage API. This information never leaves your device.

## How Your Information Is Used

Your locally stored preferences are used solely to:

- Remember which redirects you have enabled/disabled
- Remember whether the extension as a whole is enabled/disabled
- Save your customized settings between browser sessions

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share or disclose any information because:

1. We don't collect any data that could be shared
2. The extension operates entirely locally on your device
3. No data is transmitted to any external servers (ours or third parties)

## Third-Party Services

When you use PrivacyRedirect+, you will be redirected to privacy-friendly alternatives via [farside.link](https://farside.link). Please note:

- We have no control over these third-party services
- Each service has its own privacy policy
- We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these services
- Farside.link acts as a redirect service and may have its own privacy practices

## Your Choices and Rights

You have complete control over the extension:

- Toggle the entire extension on/off
- Choose which specific sites to redirect
- Uninstall the extension at any time to remove all stored preferences

## Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information depends on the security of your browser. Chrome's Storage API provides isolation between extensions, meaning other extensions cannot access PrivacyRedirect+'s data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the GitHub repository. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on our GitHub repository or contact the maintainer directly.

## Effective Date

This Privacy Policy is effective as of [Date].
